                    Hey Guys!! I'm Pushpa Maithri and you can call me Maithri ( I'm not used to people calling by my first name ðŸ˜…). I come from Andhra Pradesh in India. As you have come to this page... You would have already known that I'm a MSc Computing student at University of Northampton. So to tell you a bit about me I'm an outgoing person. I completed my studies till undergradutation from India and worked on Adobe Experience Management in Infosys Ltd. I love singing my heart out ( mostly in the shower) and reading supernatural fiction books especially werewolves and vampires ðŸ˜„. I also watch webseries and Kdramas as well. I stan BTS (for those who don't know its a boy band from South Korea). </p>

            <h2>My Favourite Artist!</h2>
            <div>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Its BTS&#128151; The reason why I love them is their music and songs cheers me up whenever I feel depressed or happy as people say "There is no language barrier when it comes to Music". I started to love myself more through them and get inspired from BTS like how they have become from a small boy band in South Korea to global superstars.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>My Favourite Webseries!</h2>
            <div>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">My most fav webseries is "The Originals", a supernatural fiction series where the story revolves around the vampires, werewolves and the witches. The famous quote from the webseries "Always and Forever" a vow that teaches family above all and its everything that is needed.<br>
                The second one is "Lucifer" a fictional series about The Devil and we get to see the villian's side story.</p>
